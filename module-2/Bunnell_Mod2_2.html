    <h1>Assignment 2.2 – Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1: My Story</h2>

    <p class="intro">
      I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, where the changing seasons made life interesting. Winters were cold and snowy, while summers were hot and humid. 
      My childhood was full of outdoor adventures, <span class="sentence">and I always enjoyed exploring new things with friends in my neighborhood.</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      My family has always been close-knit, and we spent a lot of time together. We often had family dinners, celebrated holidays, and supported each other in everything. 
      Growing up in such an environment taught me the importance of strong relationships.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of my biggest hobbies is playing poker, which challenges me to think strategically and make decisions under pressure. 
      I also enjoy technology, and I spend much of my free time learning about programming and software development. 
      These interests help me grow both personally and professionally.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition to poker and technology, I like to stay active by running and hiking. I find that being outdoors clears my mind and helps me focus better on my studies. 
      I also enjoy traveling whenever I can, as it gives me new perspectives on life. 
      Overall, I strive to keep a good balance between work, hobbies, and family.
    </p>
